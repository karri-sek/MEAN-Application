## My Views in attacking this challenge

## There are two versions of solutions in this repo.

* simply index.html contains the inbuilt angular script which fetches the data and display's it.
* A MEAN stack application is created in order to fetch the results from mongoDB.

# Steps to execute:
## Solution 1
##### simply open the index.html in any browser and click the search button, it will fetch the results and displays it.
##### paths to the css and js are related to this repository, please download the code base if the css not rendered properly.

## Solution 2
### clone the repo
### npm install from the repo directory
### bower install
### nodemon server.js
### server starts listen at http://localhost:3030/ open this in browser.


Note:
 * Please run npm install and bower install in order to run this application

### Converted this simple single page web application into a application using MEAN stack
### MEAN(MongoDB, Express JS, Angular JS, Node JS)

Changes:
* I would like to use express js as server for this application.
* Created a new database called expo and challange collection
* used Angular JS as front end framework for this application.
* Used jade as template engine
* Used stylus as CSS preprocessor.
