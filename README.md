# My Views in attacking this challenge

Note:
 * Please run npm install and bower install in order to run this application

### Converted this simple single page web application into a application using MEAN stack
### MEAN(MongoDB, Express JS, Angular JS, Node JS)

Changes:
* I would like to use express js as server for this application.
* Created a new database called expo and challange collection
* used Angular JS as front end framework for this application.
* Used jade as template engine
* Used stylus as CSS preprocessor.
